# MyOffers â€” Android app (Jetpack Compose)

A smooth, fast Android app that shows offers around Sri Lanka across all sectors. Filter by sector, city, hot deals, and sort by ending soon or top discount. The search bar lives at the bottom for quick access.

- Filters: sector, city, hot-only
- Sorting: Best, Ending Soon, Highest Discount
- Bottom search bar
- Offer details
- Simple, attractive colors with dark mode
- Smooth animations (list reordering, fades, badges)

## Tech
- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose + Material 3
